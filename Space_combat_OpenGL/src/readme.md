#### Instructions:
#### Keyboard:
	Key "Esc": exit
	Key "UP": Move the spacecraft forward (With an acceleration process).
	Key "DOWN": Move the spacecraft backwad (With an acceleration process).
	Key "LEFT": Move the spacecraft to the left.
	Key "RIGHT": Move the spacecraft to the right.
	Key "Q": Make the spacecraft turn left (Similar to mouse control).
	Key "E": Make the spacecraft turn right (Similar to mouse control).
	Key "LEFT_SHIFT": Use the booster (Increase the maximum velocity and acceleration).
	Key "W": Increase the brightness of directional light.
	Key "S": Reduce the brightness of directional light.

#### Mouse:
	Change camera position: Press and hold the left button then move the mouse.


#### Manipulation:
#### Features:
There are multiple objects rendered in the scene, including the planet, the spacecraft, the vehicle, the asteroid ring, the spacestation and the ufo.

The planet is mapped by combining 3 textures, including the earth surface, the earth cloud and the earth illumination.
(Reference: [https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/space/planet/earth-and-international-space-station](https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/space/planet/earth-and-international-space-station))

Also, the earth normal is mapped onto it. It does self-rotation all the time.

The spacecraft could be controlled with the instructions below, to make it more realistic, I've add the velocity and acceleration when moving forward and 	backward, so it takes some time for it to reach its max speed. You can hold left shift to increase the maximum velocity and acceleration.

The camera viewpoint is always behind and a little bit above the spacecraft.

The vehicle and the ufo are quite similar, the vehicle is given in the package and the ufo is found online.(Reference: [https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/space/spaceship/free-flying-saucer](https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/space/spaceship/free-flying-saucer))

They are always doing self-rotation and are randomly jumping within a certain horizontal area at a certain time. When the spacecraft touches them, they will change their rotation speed and texture color forever, and they stay put until the spacecraft moves away.

The asteroid ring is waiting to be added by teammate.

The spacestation is a static object loaded online.(Reference: [https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/space/other/overseer-station-element-one--3]( https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/space/other/overseer-station-element-one--3))

There is a skybox showing the universe.

There are two light sources, one is directional light with sunlight (yellow) color, one is point light with ocean (blue) color.

The directional light could be controlled with the instructions above.
